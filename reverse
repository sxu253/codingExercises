/*
BJP4 Exercise 11.18: reverse
Write a method reverse that accepts a Map from integers to strings as a parameter and returns a new Map of strings 
to integers that is the original's "reverse". The reverse of a map is defined here to be a new map that uses the 
values from the original as its keys and the keys from the original as its values. Since a map's values need not 
be unique but its keys must be, it is acceptable to have any of the original keys as the value in the result. 
In other words, if the original map has pairs (k1, v) and (k2, v), the new map must contain either 
the pair (v, k1) or (v, k2).

public static Map<String,Integer> reverse(Map<Integer,String> change){
    Map<String,Integer> changed = new HashMap<String,Integer>();
    Set<Integer> holdKeys = new HashSet<Integer>(change.keySet());
    //List<Integer> holdValues = new List<Integer>(change.keySet());
    Iterator<Integer> itrS = holdKeys.iterator();
    //Iterator<Integer> itrI = holdValues.iterator();
    while(itrS.hasNext()){
        Integer num = itrS.next();
        changed.put(change.get(num),num);
    }
    return changed;
